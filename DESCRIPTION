Description: Three methods are implemented in R to facilitate the aggregations of flags in official statistics.  
            From the underlying flags the highest in the hierarchy, the most frequent, or with the highest total weight
            is propagated to the flag(s) for EU or other aggregates. Below there are some reference documents for the topic:
